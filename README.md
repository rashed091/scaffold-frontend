# Introduction
The goal of this repo is setup a react app with typescript support, by removing the middle man create-react-app which abstrat a lot of details from a beginer like me. I'm very insterested in how things done behind the sence and how one day I can build tool like that of my own. So I spend considerable amount of time getting to know tools by doing hands on tutorial.

For someone who already experience with webpack and babel setup process, they can just ignore everything here and type:

```
npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript
```

If you are still reading then I'm guessing that you want to learn how to do everthing from scratch. So please follow along the guide.
